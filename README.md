## About

Replicated this stock display application: https://vhixt.csb.app/. Used React + Vite and React-Router library to simulate a multipage application.

## Work in Progress

Features I'd like to add:

1. Pull data from an API instead of using hard-coded stocks data
2. Design

## Installation Instructions

1. clone repository
2. Navigate to folder and open on local machine
   - cd into folder
3. Create new React project: `npm create vite@latest .`
   - Select framework: React
   - Select output: JavaScript
4. Install: `npm install`
5. Start server: `npm run dev`
